# Find the Time

[Find the Time](https://babar-gh.github.io/find-the-time/) is a simple and straightforward app for event scheduling. With it you can choose the time that works best for everyone you’ve invited based on when they are available.

## How does it work?

- Create an event by specifying its name, location, duration and optional description. Most importantly, set the time intervals in which your event can happen.
- Share it with others.
- The people you invited will narrow your intervals according to their availability.
- When everybody subscribed, you will be shown the time frames when everybody is available.
- Now all that’s left is for you to pick when your event will happen within these frames!

When you launch the demo, we populate your account with a number of mock events: some are organized by you; in others you’re a subscriber. Some are pending and others — past and archived.
